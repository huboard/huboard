        Dragging issues between milestones provides a MUCH needed complement to an amazing feature from GitHub. No more spending hours checking checkboxes and paging through

        Huboard is built from the ground up using the GitHub public API. Huboard issues <strong>are</strong> GitHub issues,you will 
        never have to deal with syncronization problems. Keep issues where they belong, in the repository with your code!

We're a distributed team that loves markers and paper. When we can't all
be in the same place, Huboard is the best alternative we've found to a nice
sharpie and some index cards. Plus, Github. Huboard is the animated gifs of
kanban style Github issue management.

            Huboard brought together the two key features I needed for projects I was leading.
            It's open source, integrates with GitHub issues, and has an extremely simple and clean approach to the UX.
            This has made it my go to for kanban with a remote, fast moving, and high caliber team.
            Oh, and forgot to mention, the drag and drop for those that don't want to dig around the issues on GitHub is a life saver!

            I love that Huboard enables us to keep our development tasks AND our project management tasks in a single repository (GitHub Issues).
            Huboard provides the best fusion between development and product management I've ever seen.
            It lets us stay light and nimble while providing the same level of accountability and trace-ability of a big ALM tool.
            Huboard blows the heavy 'enterprisey' ALM tools out of the water AND keeps my developers happy!
