# Welcome to Huboard

How to set up YOUR repo
--------------------------
* * *

Add labels to your repository with the following pattern

>  # - Title

>  # == index of column
>  Title == column header

Example:

>  1 - Backlog

>  2 - Ready

>  3 - Working

>  4 - Done

The number represents the index of the column and the will be the column header

To move a card with a commit message add "push GH-#" anywhere in your commit message

Other supported key words

> push GH-#

> pushed GH-#

> move GH-#

> moves GH-#

* ~~Make sure you create a hook for the Repository on the home page. Only click the button once (known defect)~~
* Currently you can only move one card per commit message (will fix soon)

How to link repositories together
--------------------------
* * *

Add labels to your repository with the following pattern

>  Link <=> username/repo

Example:

> Link <=> rauhryan/ghee

For help distiguishing cards add a custom color to label and huboard
will add a border to issues belonging to the linked board

![linked board](http://f.cl.ly/items/13453x43053r2G0d3x0v/Screen%20Shot%202012-04-28%20at%2010.48.17%20AM.png)

Bugs
--------------------------
* * *

* ~~creates multiple post-receive hooks, only click once. You can manually delete the hook from the admin panel on github~~
* Milestones reordering takes a few seconds and I don't have a loading screen on there yet so give it a few seconds


Notes
--------------------------
* * *

* Milestones reordering will change the due date of your milestone. (currently the only way to order then)
* commit message that "push GH-#" past the last column close the issue

## To run locally

### Install Pow from [pow.cx](http://pow.cx)

Configure your app for pow:

    cd ~/.pow
    ln -s /path/to/huboard

Sinatra doesn't automatically reload changes to your app, so tell Pow to restart on every request:

    cd /path/to/huboard
    mkdir tmp
    touch tmp/always_restart.txt

### Configure RVM

    cp .rvmrc.sample .rvmrc

Edit `.rvmrc` to specify your ruby version/gemset

Recommend MRI 1.9.2, to match the [bamboo stack on heroku](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/stack)

### Install dependencies

    gem install bundler -v 1.1.rc
    bundle install

### Register app for Github OAuth

Go to https://github.com/account/applications and register your
application to get the application keys needed for OAuth.

- URL: `http://huboard.dev`
- Callback: `http://huboard.dev/auth/github/callback`

### Configure your app

    cp .settings.sample .settings

Edit `.settings` to set the Client ID and Client Secret provided by
Github when you registered the application.

### Try the app

Open your browser to http://huboard.dev/board


## Deploy to Heroku

[Sign up](https://api.heroku.com/signup) on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) if you don't have an account, and install the heroku gem:

```
[sudo] gem install heroku
```

### 1. Create the Heroku App

##### Clone Huboard:

```
git clone https://github.com/rauhryan/huboard.git
cd huboard
```

##### Bundle:

```
bundle install
```

##### Create the app:

```
heroku app:create ---stack cedar
```

or, if you'd prefer to name your app yourself:

```
heroku app:create <your-app-name> --stack cedar
```


### 2. Register app for Github OAuth

Go to https://github.com/account/applications and register your
application to get the application keys needed for OAuth.

- URL: `http://<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com`
- Callback: `http://<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com/auth/github/callback`


### 3. Configure a Github Team

Create a Github team that will be used by Huboard, or use an existing one. 

Make note of the team ID. You can see it in the URL when editing the team.

*If you get bounced by [SecuroCat](http://octodex.github.com/bouncer/), you should first check your team ID.*


### 4. Configure Heroku Environment

Now you'll need to setup some environment variables on Heroku. 

Customize your values and run the following from your project root:

```
heroku config:add \
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID='<your-github-oauth-client>' \
  GITHUB_SECRET='<your-github-oauth-secret>' \
  SECRET_KEY='<your-random-secret-key>' \
  SESSION_SECRET='<your-complex-session-secret>' \
  TEAM_ID='<your-github-team-id>'
```

### 5. Deploy

```
git push heroku master
```
